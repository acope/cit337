                    <p>Throughout the whole course we were taught to use <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr> and to work collaboratively amoung the groups. To develop an application we used "shall" statements to describe the system-level requirements that were given by the operational concept that was given to us. From there we were able to write a "user story" that described the way in which the application will interact with an external actor to implement the functional requirement in the "shall" statement. We also were taught how to translate the user story into an <abbr title="Unified Modding Language">UML</abbr> Diagram </p>

                        <div class"row">
                            <p>The Guessing Game was developed using TDD and Agile Development. What The Guessing Game does is, you choose a number 1 to 1024 and the computer will guess your number in 10 guesses or less. To develop the game, the class was divided into three teams: Android <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Team, Java App Team, <abbr title="Leas Systems Integrator">LSI</abbr>. My role in the project was the <abbr title="Assistant Project Manager">APM</abbr> on the LSI team. The role of the APM was to develop a schedule of project milestones that support the scheduled customer project review. During my time as the APM I created and manged the <abbr title="Risk Management Matrix">RMM</abbr> and project milestones. I also managed and kept track of the other five members of my team and made sure thier tasks were completed and done correct as well as keeping my project manager up to date on what was going on in the LSI team. <br> Before any programming was done an user story was developed from our list of requirements then from there a UMl model could be developed for the user interface and Java code. Once the UML model was developed, the Java App Team could get started with the programming of The Guessing Game while the UI could get started on the looks and feels of the game. During the whole development of the game, the LSI team work closely with both teams and keeping them on schedule and making sure each group was updated on each others progress and setbacks. Overall the game was a simple game to produce but with working with a gorup of thirty people and using TDD with Agile Development it helped to create what could of been a headache of a project to a simple and effective way of developing a project.</p>
